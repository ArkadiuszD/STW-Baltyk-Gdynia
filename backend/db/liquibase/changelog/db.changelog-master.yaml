  # STW Baltyk Gdynia - Database Changelog Master
  # ============================================================================
  # This is the master changelog file that includes all database changes.
  # Changes are organized by version/release.
  #
  # Best Practices:
  # - Never modify existing changesets after deployment
  # - Always add new changesets at the end
  # - Use meaningful IDs: <category>-<sequence>-<description>
  # - Include rollback statements where possible
  # - Use preconditions for safety
  # ============================================================================
